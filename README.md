# Know Thyself v2.0

This a simplistic choose-your-adventure game where you are presented with multiple actions on different scenarios with an overarching and branching story. 
By the end of the story your chosen actions will determine what alignment you fall onto in the [Alignment Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).
**Will you get the result you think you will?**

This software is currently in production, with 3 major versions planned:

- **Prototype (v1.0)**

Simple terminal project that allows for options in the story to be selected via terminal input. Kept here recieving updates until fully completed (full details [there](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Know_Thyself_Prototype))

- **Web App Frontend (v2.0)**

  - Planned: Webapp version that will utilize Spring Boot and have a front-end. This will include Home, Play, About, & Credits as the main pages. Results will be saved. Possible longer or multiple stories.
    
  - Currently: A front and backend web service skeleton to build for completed prototype logic to be contained in.

- **Story Editor Update (v2.5)**
An ability to create and write your own branching stories that you can play through yourself or share with others! This won't be a separate project but an update to this one. This one is a big ***MAYBE.***
