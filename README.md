# Know Thyself v2.0

This a simplistic choose-your-adventure web app where you are presented with multiple actions in different scenarios with an overarching and branching story. 
By the end of the story your chosen actions will determine what alignment you fall onto in the [Alignment Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).
**Will you get the result you think you will?**

This web app is currently in production with these planned versions:

**Prototype**

Simple terminal project that allows for options in the story to be selected via terminal input. Can be found [here](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Know_Thyself_Prototype)

**Web App Frontend (v1.0)**

Spring Boot & Thymeleaf framework with various informative pages and a way to play the short story game.

**Story Editor Update (v2.0)**

An ability to create and write your own branching stories that you can play through yourself or share with others. Will most likely connect to a database to store the stories. This won't be a separate project but an update to this one. This one is a big ***MAYBE.***
