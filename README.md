# Know Thyself 

This a simplistic choose-your-adventure web app where you are presented with multiple actions in different scenarios with an overarching and branching story. 
By the end of the story your chosen actions will determine what alignment you fall onto in the [Alignment Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).
**Will you get the result you think you will?**

This web app is currently in production. It utilizes Spring Boot & Thymeleaf framework and Bootstrap libraries, containing various informative pages and a way to play the short story game that can be found [here](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Know_Thyself_Prototype)

### Instructions 
1. Download all files from the project
2. Using an IDE (I use [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/)) and an automated build tool (I used Maven), import the project files as an "existing project", selecting the _pom.xml_ file.
3. Then Update the project. This should also download the required libraries for the project to run from the pom file.
4. Run the project and make your way to http://localhost:8080
