# Know Thyself 

This a simplistic choose-your-adventure web app where you are presented with multiple actions in different scenarios with an overarching and branching story. 
By the end of the story your chosen actions will determine what alignment you fall onto in the [Alignment Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).
**Will you get the result you think you will?**

This web app is currently in production. It will utilize Spring Boot & Thymeleaf framework with various informative pages and a way to play the short story game. Terminal version can be found [here](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Know_Thyself_Prototype)
